In the last post, we gained access to _bandit7_. Now, let’s find the password for _bandit8._

### Level 8

> Level Goal
>
> The password for the next level is stored in the file **data.txt** next to the word **millionth**
>
> Commands you may need to solve this level
>
> grep, sort, uniq, strings, base64, tr, tar, gzip, bzip2, xxd

Let’s find out what we have in our directory.

```shell
bandit7@bandit:~$ ls  
data.txt
```

We see **data.txt**. Let’s see what’s inside.

```shell
bandit7@bandit:~$ cat data.txt  
// really really long output
```

So data.txt is a super long file with many lines.

The **cat** kept printing lines for so long I had to restart my terminal.

The level goal said the password was next to the word **millionth.** So let’s try using the **_grep_** command.

The [**_grep_**](https://linuxcommand.org/lc3_man_pages/grep1.html) command is used to find strings or patterns inside text. We can use this command to find the line in **data.txt** which has the word **millionth**.

```shell
bandit7@bandit:~$ cat data.txt | grep millionth  
millionth cvX2JJa4CFALtqS87jk27qwqGhBM9plV
```

And we have the password for _bandit8_, **cvX2JJa4CFALtqS87jk27qwqGhBM9plV.**

### Level 9

> Level Goal
>
> The password for the next level is stored in the file **data.txt** and is the only line of text that occurs only once
>
> Commands you may need to solve this level
>
> grep, sort, uniq, strings, base64, tr, tar, gzip, bzip2, xxd

If we try reading the contents of **data.txt** using **_cat_**, we get a lot of lines of random characters.

We’re going to figure out which of these lines occurs only once.

There is a command called **_uniq_** which can identify unique lines in a given file. It has a flag, **_\-u_**, which returns unique lines alone.

But the problem with **_uniq_** is that it doesn’t detect repeated lines unless they’re adjacent. To overcome this, **_uniq_** needs to be used along with **_sort_**, which sorts the contents of a given file.

So once we sort the contents of the file, the repeated lines will be adjacent, so that **_uniq -u_** can detect and ignore those lines.

```shell
bandit8@bandit:~$ sort data.txt | uniq -u  
UsvVyFSfZZWbi6wgC7dAFyFuR6jQQUhR
```

And we have the password for _bandit9_, **UsvVyFSfZZWbi6wgC7dAFyFuR6jQQUhR**.

### Level 10

> Level Goal
>
> The password for the next level is stored in the file **data.txt** in one of the few human-readable strings, preceded by several ‘=’ characters.
>
> Commands you may need to solve this level
>
> grep, sort, uniq, strings, base64, tr, tar, gzip, bzip2, xxd

The **_file_** command helped us determine which files were **human readable** among other files.

But now, we need to figure out which lines of a given file are human readable. For this, we have the **_strings_** command.

This command returns only the **human readable** strings in a given file, ignoring the other non-ASCII characters.

But even just this command alone is going to return a lot of strings we don’t need.

> preceded by several ‘=’ characters.

From this line, we know that we’re looking for a line the contains several ‘=’ characters. To narrow down our search based on this information, we can use the **_grep_** command along with the **_strings_** command.

```shell
bandit9@bandit:~$ strings data.txt | grep "=="  
\========== the\*2i"4  
\========== password  
Z)========== is  
&========== truKLdjsbJ5g7yyJ2X2R0o3a5HQJFuLk
```

Now, we’ve narrowed the results down to four strings. Based on the previous passwords, it is safe to assume that the password is **truKLdjsbJ5g7yyJ2X2R0o3a5HQJFuLk**.

---

### Level 11

> Level Goal
>
> The password for the next level is stored in the file **data.txt**, which contains base64 encoded data
>
> Commands you may need to solve this level
>
> grep, sort, uniq, strings, base64, tr, tar, gzip, bzip2, xxd

Let’s find out what’s inside **data.txt**.

```shell
bandit10@bandit:~$ ls  
data.txt  
bandit10@bandit:~$ cat data.txt  
VGhlIHBhc3N3b3JkIGlzIElGdWt3S0dzRlc4TU9xM0lSRnFyeEUxaHhUTkViVVBSCg==
```

According to the level goal, the contents of **data.txt** are **base64 encoded** data. Read more about [**base64** here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64).

There is a command to perform base64 operations known as [**base64.**](https://linux.die.net/man/1/base64) It has a flag, -d, which stands for decode, and is used to decode base64 encoded values.

```shell
bandit10@bandit:~$ base64 -d data.txt  
The password is IFukwKGsFW8MOq3IRFqrxE1hxTNEbUPR
```

And we have our password for _bandit11_, **IFukwKGsFW8MOq3IRFqrxE1hxTNEbUPR**.

---

### Level 12

> Level Goal
>
> The password for the next level is stored in the file **data.txt**, where all lowercase (a-z) and uppercase (A-Z) letters have been rotated by 13 positions
>
> Commands you may need to solve this level
>
> grep, sort, uniq, strings, base64, tr, tar, gzip, bzip2, xxd

Let’s see what’s inside **data.txt**.

```shell
bandit11@bandit:~$ cat data.txt  
Gur cnffjbeq vf 5Gr8L4qetPEsPk8htqjhRK8XSP6x2RHh
```

> all lowercase (a-z) and uppercase (A-Z) letters have been rotated by 13 positions

This means that a=n, b=o, c=p, and so on till m=z, and then n=a, o=b, p=c and so on till z=m. This is known as **ROT13**, which is a letter substitution cipher. You can read more about [ROT13 here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13).

The **ROT13 cipher** uses the **same algorithm** for **encryption** and **decryption**. So, to decrypt a ROT13 encrypted file, we need to perform the **same operation** as encryption, which is to rotate each letter by 13 positions.

To decode **data.txt** we need to implement the **ROT13 cipher** using the **_tr_** command. You can read more about the [**_tr_** command here](https://linuxcommand.org/lc3_man_pages/tr1.html).

```shell
bandit11@bandit:~$ cat data.txt | tr 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m'  
The password is 5Te8Y4drgCRfCx8ugdwuEX8KFC6k2EUu
```

And we have the password for _bandit12_, **5Te8Y4drgCRfCx8ugdwuEX8KFC6k2EUu**.

### Level 13

> Level Goal
>
> The password for the next level is stored in the file **data.txt**, which is a hexdump of a file that has been repeatedly compressed. For this level it may be useful to create a directory under /tmp in which you can work using mkdir. For example: mkdir /tmp/myname123. Then copy the datafile using cp, and rename it using mv (read the manpages!)
>
> Commands you may need to solve this level
>
> grep, sort, uniq, strings, base64, tr, tar, gzip, bzip2, xxd, mkdir, cp, mv, file

That’s a lot of new things. Let’s try and break it down.

The first thing they ask us to do is,

> **create a directory** under **/tmp** in which you can work using **mkdir**.

So let’s do that.

```shell
bandit12@bandit:~$ cd /tmp  
bandit12@bandit:/tmp$ mkdir test1234  
bandit12@bandit:/tmp$ cd test1234  
bandit12@bandit:/tmp/test1234$
```

So now we have our own directory under **/tmp**.

> Then copy the datafile using cp, and rename it using mv (read the manpages!)

```shell
bandit12@bandit:/tmp/test1234$ cp /home/bandit12/data.txt .  
bandit12@bandit:/tmp/test1234$ mv data.txt myData.txt  
bandit12@bandit:/tmp/test1234$ ls  
myData.txt
```

Now we have a **copy of data.txt** in our directory, which has been **renamed** to **myData.txt**.

We’ve been asked to do this since we **don’t** have **write** permissions in the **_/home/bandit12_** directory. But in our own directory, we can write anything.

This is essential for this level as we need to **modify** the contents of **myData.txt**.

Now let’s see what we need to do next.

> The password for the next level is stored in the file **data.txt**, which is a hexdump of a file that has been repeatedly compressed.

So myData.txt is a **hexdump**. Read more about [hexdump here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hex_dump).

In order to decrypt myData.txt, we need to perform a **reverse hexdump**.

A hexdump is done using the command [**_xxd_**](https://linux.die.net/man/1/xxd#:~:text=xxd%20creates%20a%20hex%20dump,of%20decoding%20to%20standard%20output.). A reverse hexdump can be achieved using **_xxd -r_**.

```shell
bandit12@bandit:/tmp/test1234$ xxd -r myData.txt  
J쌑Oϊ{RBpQixYZ!dj(搿ݳ/A#  dbX?z2<A n}4hFF4LM @zFMChFC@4[@fh](http://twitter.com/fh "Twitter profile for @fh") ihPhMh

```

But we need to store the output of the **_xxd -r_**.

```shell
bandit12@bandit:/tmp/test1234$ xxd -r myData.txt | cat > reverse  
bandit12@bandit:/tmp/test1234$ cat reverse  
J쌑Oϊ{RBpQixYZ!dj(搿ݳ/A#  dbX?z2<A n}4hFF4LM @zFMChFC@4[@fh](http://twitter.com/fh "Twitter profile for @fh") ihPhMh

```

Now we have a file named **reverse** which contains the **un-hexdumped** version of **myData.txt**.

> hexdump of a file that has been repeatedly compressed.

The file we have now is a compressed file. There are 5 ways to compress files in Linux. You can read about them [here](https://www.networkworld.com/article/3538471/how-to-compress-files-on-linux-5-ways.html#:~:text=The%20gzip%20command%20is%20very,replaced%20by%20the%20encrypted%20file.).

To find out what was used to compress the file, we can use the **_file_** command (we already know that file tells us the type of the contents of the file, so in this case it will reveal the compression method used).

```shell
bandit12@bandit:/tmp/test1234$ file reverse  
reverse: gzip compressed data, was "data2.bin", last modified: Thu May  7 18:14:30 2020, max compression, from Unix
```

So now we know that reverse was compressed using **gzip**.

We need to **decompress** our file, reverse using **_gzip -d_**. But gzip -d only works on **.gz** files. So let’s **rename** our **reverse** to **reverse.gz** and **decompress** it.

```shell
bandit12@bandit:/tmp/test1234$ mv reverse reverse.gz  
bandit12@bandit:/tmp/test1234$ gzip -d reverse.gz  
bandit12@bandit:/tmp/test1234$ ls  
myData.txt  reverse  
bandit12@bandit:/tmp/test1234$ file reverse  
reverse: bzip2 compressed data, block size = 900k
```

Our file, **reverse.gz**, was **decompressed** and stored under the name **reversed**, which was compressed using **bzip2**. So lets decompress it using **_bzip2 -d_**.

```shell
bandit12@bandit:/tmp/test1234$ bzip2 -d reverse  
bzip2: Can't guess original name for reverse -- using reverse.out  
bandit12@bandit:/tmp/test1234$ file reverse.out  
reverse.out: gzip compressed data, was "data4.bin", last modified: Thu May  7 18:14:30 2020, max compression, from Unix
```

So **reverse**, got **decompressed** to **reverse.out**, which is is a **gzip compressed** file. Notice how we didn’t have any problem with the **file extension** in **bzip2**. Let’s keep decompressing!

```shell
bandit12@bandit:/tmp/test1234$ mv reverse.out reverse.gz  
bandit12@bandit:/tmp/test1234$ gzip -d reverse.gz  
bandit12@bandit:/tmp/test1234$ ls  
myData.txt  reverse  
bandit12@bandit:/tmp/test1234$ file reverse  
reverse: POSIX tar archive (GNU)
```

Now we see that reverse is a **tar archive**. So we need to use the **tar** command. **_Tar_** also only works with **.tar** files, so we first need to rename reverse. Then we can use **_\-xf_** to **extract** files from the **tar archive**.

```shell
bandit12@bandit:/tmp/test1234$ mv reverse reverse.tar  
bandit12@bandit:/tmp/test1234$ tar -xf reverse.tar  
bandit12@bandit:/tmp/test1234$ ls  
data5.bin  myData.txt  reverse.tar  
bandit12@bandit:/tmp/test1234$ file data5.bin  
data5.bin: POSIX tar archive (GNU)
```

**_tar -xf_** returned a file named data5.bin which is also a tar archive. Let’s unarchive it.

```shell
bandit12@bandit:/tmp/test1234$ mv data5.bin data5.tar  
bandit12@bandit:/tmp/test1234$ tar -xf data5.tar  
bandit12@bandit:/tmp/test1234$ ls  
data5.tar  data6.bin  myData.txt  reverse.tar  
bandit12@bandit:/tmp/test1234$ file data6.bin  
data6.bin: bzip2 compressed data, block size = 900k  
bandit12@bandit:/tmp/test1234$ bzip2 -d data6.bin  
bzip2: Can't guess original name for data6.bin -- using data6.bin.out  
bandit12@bandit:/tmp/test1234$ file data6.bin.out  
data6.bin.out: POSIX tar archive (GNU)  
bandit12@bandit:/tmp/test1234$ mv data6.bin.out data6.tar  
bandit12@bandit:/tmp/test1234$ tar -xf data6.tar  
bandit12@bandit:/tmp/test1234$ ls  
data5.tar  data6.tar  data8.bin  myData.txt  reverse.tar  
bandit12@bandit:/tmp/test1234$ file data8.bin  
data8.bin: gzip compressed data, was "data9.bin", last modified: Thu May  7 18:14:30 2020, max compression, from Unix  
bandit12@bandit:/tmp/test1234$ mv data8.bin data8.gz  
bandit12@bandit:/tmp/test1234$ gzip -d data8.gz  
bandit12@bandit:/tmp/test1234$ ls  
data5.tar  data6.tar  data8  myData.txt  reverse.tar  
bandit12@bandit:/tmp/test1234$ file data8  
data8: ASCII text
```

Finally, we have a file that is just ASCII text, and not a compressed file.

```shell
bandit12@bandit:/tmp/test1234$ cat data8  
The password is 8ZjyCRiBWFYkneahHwxCv3wb2a1ORpYL
```

And we have the password for _bandit13_, **8ZjyCRiBWFYkneahHwxCv3wb2a1ORpYL**.

### Level 14

> Level Goal
>
> The password for the next level is stored in **/etc/bandit\_pass/bandit14 and can only be read by user bandit14**. For this level, you don’t get the next password, but you get a private SSH key that can be used to log into the next level. **Note:** **localhost** is a hostname that refers to the machine you are working on
>
> Commands you may need to solve this level
>
> ssh, telnet, nc, openssl, s\_client, nmap

So we don’t find the password for _bandit14_ like we’ve been doing up until now.

```shell
bandit13@bandit:~$ ls  
sshkey.private
```

The directory only contains a file known as **sshkey.private**. From what was told to us in the level goal, we can assume it contains the private SSH key for _bandit14_. Read more about private keys [here](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SSH/OpenSSH/Keys).

```shell
bandit13@bandit:~$ cat sshkey.private

\-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
```

So our goal is to use this key to login to _bandit14_. I used the steps from [this page](https://docs.rackspace.com/support/how-to/logging-in-with-an-ssh-private-key-on-linuxmac/) to login to _bandit14_ using a private key instead of a regular password.

First, copy the private key and store it in a file.

Then change file permissions to 600 using **_chmod_** command. Read about [file permissions](https://www.linux.com/training-tutorials/understanding-linux-file-permissions/) and [chmod](https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/trusty/man1/chmod.1.html).

```
$ chmod 600 bandit14\_key.txt
```

And now we can SSH into _bandit14_ using the private key as an arguement.

```shell
$ ssh -i bandit14\_key.txt bandit14@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```
And you should be inside _bandit14_!

---

### Level 15

> Level Goal
>
> The password for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to **port 30000 on localhost**.
>
> Commands you may need to solve this level
>
> ssh, telnet, nc, openssl, s\_client, nmap

To get the password for _bandit15_, we need to submit the password of _bandit14_ to **localhost** on **port 30000**. But we don’t know the password for _bandit14_ yet, because we logged in using **SSH private key**.

In the previous level, we were told that the password for _bandit14_ is stored in **/etc/bandit\_pass/bandit14**. So let’s first get the password.

```shell
bandit14@bandit:~$ cat /etc/bandit\_pass/bandit14  
4wcYUJFw0k0XLShlDzztnTBHiqxU3b3e
```

Now, we have the password for _bandit14_, we have to submit it to localhost port 30000. We can do this using the *_netcat_* command.

```shell
bandit14@bandit:~$ nc localhost 30000
```

We now have a connection to localhost on port 30000. Now, we can enter the password for *_bandit14_*.

```shell
bandit14@bandit:~$ nc localhost 30000
4wcYUJFw0k0XLShlDzztnTBHiqxU3b3e
Correct!
BfMYroe26WYalil77FoDi9qh59eK5xNr
```

And we have the password for _bandit15_, **BfMYroe26WYalil77FoDi9qh59eK5xNr**.

---

### Level 16

>
> **Helpful note: Getting “HEARTBEATING” and “Read R BLOCK”? Use -ign\_eof and read the “CONNECTED COMMANDS” section in the manpage. Next to ‘R’ and ‘Q’, the ‘B’ command also works in this version of that command…**

>
> ssh, telnet, nc, openssl, s\_client, nmap

To get the password for bandit16, we need to use SSL encryption to connect to localhost on port 30001.

This is similar to the previous level, but instead of using the **_netcat_** command, we need to use the **_openssl_** and **_s\_client_** commands. Read about [openssl](https://linux.die.net/man/1/openssl) and [s\_client](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.0.2/man1/openssl-s_client.html).

### openssl Syntax
```shell
$ openssl s\_client -connect host:port
```
This syntax helps us establish a connection to a server that is also using either SSL or TLS protocol.

In our case, we need to connect to localhost on port 30001.

```shell
bandit15@bandit:~$ openssl s\_client -connect localhost:30001  
CONNECTED(00000003)  
.  
.   
.  
. // Information about SSL, TLS and the remote server  
.  
.  
.

Start Time: 1606914068  
    Timeout   : 7200 (sec)  
    Verify return code: 18 (self signed certificate)  
    Extended master secret: yes  
\---  
```

And now we can enter the password for the current level, _bandit15_.

```shell
bandit15@bandit:~$ openssl s\_client -connect localhost:30001  
CONNECTED(00000003)  
.  
.   
.  
. // Information about SSL, TLS and the remote server  
.  
.  
.

Start Time: 1606914068  
    Timeout   : 7200 (sec)  
    Verify return code: 18 (self signed certificate)  
    Extended master secret: yes  
\---  
BfMYroe26WYalil77FoDi9qh59eK5xNr  
Correct!  
cluFn7wTiGryunymYOu4RcffSxQluehd

closed
```

And we got the password for _bandit16_, **cluFn7wTiGryunymYOu4RcffSxQluehd**.

Happy Hacking!
