In the last post, we gained access to _bandit1_. Since we know how Bandit works, we know that somewhere on _bandit1_, we can find the password for _bandit2._

### Level 2

To get the instructions for Level 2, let’s head to the [Level 1 → Level 2](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit2.html) page.

> The password for the next level is stored in a file called - located in the home directory
>
> Commands you may need to solve this level
>
> ls, cd, cat, file, du, find

Just like Level 1, if you try using the **_ls_** command, you’ll see the following,

```
**bandit1@bandit:**~$ ls  
\-
```

This basically means that there’s a file named **-** in our directory.

These files are generally known as **dashed files**, since their names begin with a _dash_ or a _hyphen_.

Now, if we try using the **_cat_** command like last time, the terminal does not return anything.

```
**bandit1@bandit:**~$ cat -
```

Moreover, if we type anything and press _enter,_ the terminal just prints whatever we typed.

```
**bandit1@bandit:**~$ cat -  
test message  
test message
```

This is because files with ‘-’ in the beginning need to be delimited with ‘./’, to differentiate the filename from any options we may provide with the operator.

The dot in the delimiter represents the current directory. So when we say ‘**_./-’_** we’re basically just calling the file named ‘-’ in the current directory.

So to read the contents of **_\-,_** type

```
**bandit1@bandit:**~$ cat ./-  
CV1DtqXWVFXTvM2F0k09SHz0YwRINYA9
```

And we get the password for _bandit2,_ **CV1DtqXWVFXTvM2F0k09SHz0YwRINYA9.**

Now, you can just logout of _bandit1_ and login to _bandit2!_

Happy Hacking!
