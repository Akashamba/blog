In this post, we're going to learn how multiple instances of the same element can be removed from a list. For example, if we have a list, and we want to remove every occurrence of the number 5 from the list, this is what our result would look like.
```py
lst = [4, 9, 5, 7, 8, 5, 9, 3, 5, 8, 7]
newLst = [4, 9, 7, 8, 9, 3, 8, 7]
```

There are many ways to do this, but the simplest approach is to use list comprehension, which I have covered in a [previous post](/blog/list-comprehension), so check it out if you're unsure of what list comprehension is.

Using list comprehension, we can filter out a specific element as follows.
```py
lst = [4, 9, 5, 7, 8, 5, 9, 3, 5, 8, 7]
newLst = [x for x in lst if x != 5]
# newLst = [4, 9, 7, 8, 9, 3, 8, 7]
```
