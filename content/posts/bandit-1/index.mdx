In the last post, we successfully logged into bandit0.

The that Bandit works is, once you login to a _user_ (say, bandit0), you need to perform certain tasks to obtain the password of _next user_ (say, bandit1). Then, using SSH, we can login to the next user.

So now that we’re in _bandit0_, lets figure out the password for _bandit1._

### Level 1

The task for Level 1 is to figure out the password of bandit1 from bandit0.

Since we’re already logged into bandit0, we can start looking for the password.

To get the instructions for this level, head on over to the [Level 0 → Level 1](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit1.html) page.

> Level Goal
>
> The password for the next level is stored in a file called **readme** located in the home directory. Use this password to log into bandit1 using SSH. Whenever you find a password for a level, use SSH (on port 2220) to log into that level and continue the game.
>
> Commands you may need to solve this level
>
> ls, cd, cat, file, du, find

So we now know that the password we are looking for is in a file called **readme.** Let’s first find out what’s in our current directory.

We can do this by using the command **_ls_** in our terminal.

```
**bandit0@bandit:**~$ ls  
readme
```

We see that there is a file named **_readme._** To view the contents of the file, we use the command **_cat,_** followed by the name of the file we want to read.

```
**bandit0@bandit:**~$ cat readme  
boJ9jbbUNNfktd78OOpsqOltutMc3MY1
```

According to the instructions, the **_readme_** file contains the password for the next level, _bandit1_. So lets assume the password for _bandit1_ is **_boJ9jbbUNNfktd78OOpsqOltutMc3MY1._**

Lets try logging into _bandit1_ using the password we have just obtained.

To login to bandit1, we have to logout of bandit0 first.

We can do this using the command **_logout._**

```
**bandit0@bandit**:~$ logout  
Connection to bandit.labs.overthewire.org closed.
```

And now, we have to login to bandit1, just like we logged into bandit0, using SSH.

```
$ ssh bandit1@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220  
This is a OverTheWire game server. More information on [http://www.overthewire.org/wargames](http://www.overthewire.org/wargames)

bandit1@bandit.labs.overthewire.org’s password:
```

Paste the password that we just got (again, you won’t see any response, but your password should have been pasted), and press enter.

And you should be logged into _bandit1_!

Happy Hacking!
