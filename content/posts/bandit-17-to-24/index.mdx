In the last post, we gained access to _bandit16_. Now, let’s find the password for _bandit17_.

### Level 17

> Level Goal
>
> The credentials for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to **a port on localhost in the range 31000 to 32000**. First find out which of these ports have a server listening on them. Then find out which of those speak SSL and which don’t. There is only 1 server that will give the next credentials, the others will simply send back to you whatever you send to it.

Okay, it seems like we need to do the same thing as last time, but we need to **figure out the port on localhost which speaks SSL**. As we saw in the last post, **_openssl s\_client_** only works with other servers that also speak **SSL/TLS**.

To find out which port speaks SSL with the given **range** of **31000** to **32000**, we’ll use the **_nmap_** command. Read about **_nmap_** [here](https://linux.die.net/man/1/nmap).

Let’s scan the given range of ports using **_nmap_**.

```bash
bandit16@bandit:~$ nmap localhost -p 31000-32000

Starting Nmap 7.40 ( [https://nmap.org](https://nmap.org) ) at 2020-12-02 14:57 CET  
Nmap scan report for localhost (127.0.0.1)  
Host is up (0.00028s latency).  
Not shown: 996 closed ports  
PORT      STATE SERVICE  
31046/tcp open  unknown  
31518/tcp open  unknown  
31691/tcp open  unknown  
31790/tcp open  unknown  
31960/tcp open  unknown
```

We now have 5 possible ports. Let’s try them out.

```bash
bandit16@bandit:~$ openssl s\_client -connect localhost:31046  
\---

bandit16@bandit:~$ openssl s\_client -connect localhost:31518  
\---  
cluFn7wTiGryunymYOu4RcffSxQluehd  
cluFn7wTiGryunymYOu4RcffSxQluehd  
^C

bandit16@bandit:~$ openssl s\_client -connect localhost:31691  
\---

bandit16@bandit:~$ openssl s\_client -connect localhost:31790  
\---  
cluFn7wTiGryunymYOu4RcffSxQluehd  
Correct!  
// Long SSH Private Key

closed
```

So *port 31790* worked! And we got the *SSH key* for _*bandit17*_.

### Level 18

> Level Goal
>
> There are 2 files in the homedirectory: **passwords.old and passwords.new**. The password for the next level is in **passwords.new** and is the only line that has been changed between **passwords.old and passwords.new**
>
> **NOTE: if you have solved this level and see ‘Byebye!’ when trying to log into bandit18, this is related to the next level, bandit19**
>
> Commands you may need to solve this level
>
> cat, grep, ls, diff

Let’s see the contents of our directory.

```bash
bandit17@bandit:~$ ls  
passwords.new  passwords.old
```
> the only line that has been changed between **passwords.old and passwords.new**

So we need the one line in **passwords.new**, that isn’t there in **passwords.old**. In other words, we need the difference of **passwords.new** and **passwords.old**, (**passwords.new** **\-** **passwords.old**)

We can get this by using the diff command. Read about it [here](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/diff.1.html).

In our case, we need

```bash
bandit17@bandit:~$ diff passwords.new passwords.old  
42c42  
< **kfBf3eYk5BPBRzwjqutbbfE887SVc5Yd**  
\---  
\> w0Yfolrc5bwjS4qw5mq1nnQi6mF03bii
```

And we have the password for bandit18, **kfBf3eYk5BPBRzwjqutbbfE887SVc5Yd.**

---

### Level 19

> Level Goal
>
> The password for the next level is stored in a file **readme** in the homedirectory. Unfortunately, someone has modified **.bashrc** to log you out when you log in with SSH.
>
> Commands you may need to solve this level
>
> ssh, ls, cat

If we try logging into bandit18 with the password we have, this happens.

```bash
$ ssh bandit18@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220

Welcome to OverTheWire!

If you find any problems, please report them to Steven or morla on  
irc.overthewire.org.

\--\[ Playing the games \]--

This machine might hold several wargames.  
  If you are playing "somegame", then:

\* USERNAMES are somegame0, somegame1, ...  
    \* Most LEVELS are stored in /somegame/.  
    \* PASSWORDS for each level are stored in /etc/somegame\_pass/.

Write-access to homedirectories is disabled. It is advised to create a  
  working directory with a hard-to-guess name in /tmp/.  You can use the  
  command "mktemp -d" in order to generate a random and hard to guess  
  directory in /tmp/.  Read-access to both /tmp/ and /proc/ is disabled  
  so that users can not snoop on eachother. Files and directories with  
  easily guessable or short names will be periodically deleted!

Please play nice:

\* don't leave orphan processes running  
    \* don't leave exploit-files laying around  
    \* don't annoy other players  
    \* don't post passwords or spoilers  
    \* again, DONT POST SPOILERS!  
      This includes writeups of your solution on your blog or website!

\--\[ Tips \]--

This machine has a 64bit processor and many security-features enabled  
  by default, although ASLR has been switched off.  The following  
  compiler flags might be interesting:

\-m32                    compile for 32bit  
    -fno-stack-protector    disable ProPolice  
    -Wl,-z,norelro          disable relro

In addition, the execstack tool can be used to flag the stack as  
  executable on ELF binaries.

Finally, network-access is limited for most levels by a local  
  firewall.

\--\[ Tools \]--

For your convenience we have installed a few usefull tools which you can find  
 in the following locations:

\* gef ([https://github.com/hugsy/gef](https://github.com/hugsy/gef)) in /usr/local/gef/  
    \* pwndbg ([https://github.com/pwndbg/pwndbg](https://github.com/pwndbg/pwndbg)) in /usr/local/pwndbg/  
    \* peda ([https://github.com/longld/peda.git](https://github.com/longld/peda.git)) in /usr/local/peda/  
    \* gdbinit ([https://github.com/gdbinit/Gdbinit](https://github.com/gdbinit/Gdbinit)) in /usr/local/gdbinit/  
    \* pwntools ([https://github.com/Gallopsled/pwntools](https://github.com/Gallopsled/pwntools))  
    \* radare2 ([http://www.radare.org/](http://www.radare.org/))  
    \* checksec.sh ([http://www.trapkit.de/tools/checksec.html](http://www.trapkit.de/tools/checksec.html)) in /usr/local/bin/checksec.sh

So we can’t even enter _bandit18_. How are we supposed to access the **_readme_** file?

> Unfortunately, someone has modified **.bashrc** to log you out when you log in with SSH.

So we need to find a way around this.

**_.bashrc_** is a startup file of the bash terminal that is executed when the bash terminal is invoked. The **_.bashrc_** file of _bandit18_ is set to log us out when we login with SSH.

So we need a way to login with SSH and not call the **_.bashrc_** file.

I found [this page](https://serverfault.com/questions/94503/login-without-running-bash-profile-or-bashrc) that offers many solutions to such a problem. I'm going to use one of them for this level.

```bash
$ ssh -t bandit18@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 bash --norc   
This is a OverTheWire game server. More information on [http://www.overthewire.org/wargames](http://www.overthewire.org/wargames)

bandit18@bandit.labs.overthewire.org's password:   
bash-4.4$ ls  
readme  
bash-4.4$ cat readme  
IueksS7Ubh8G3DCwVzrTd8rAVOwq3M5x
```

And we have the password for _bandit19_, **IueksS7Ubh8G3DCwVzrTd8rAVOwq3M5x**.

### Level 20

>Level Goal
>
>To gain access to the next level, you should use the setuid binary in the homedirectory. Execute it without arguments to find out how to use it. The password for this level can be found in the usual place (/etc/bandit_pass), after you have used the setuid binary.

Let’s see what we have in our home directory.

```bash
bandit19@bandit:~$ ls
bandit20-do
bandit19@bandit:~$ file bandit20-do
bandit20-do: setuid ELF 32-bit LSB executable, Intel 80386, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib/ld-linux.so.2, for GNU/Linux 2.6.32, BuildID[sha1]=8e941f24b8c5cd0af67b22b724c57e1ab92a92a1, not stripped
```

*bandit20-do* is a setuid executable.

*Setuid*, which stands for set user ID on execution, is a special type of file permission in Unix and Unix-like operating systems such as Linux and BSD. It is a security tool that permits users to run certain programs with escalated privileges.

> Execute it without arguments to find out how to use it.

```bash
bandit19@bandit:~$ ./bandit20-do
Run a command as another user.
Example: ./bandit20-do id
```

Since we can now run commands as _bandit20_, let’s get the password from */etc/bandit_pass*.

```bash
bandit19@bandit:~$ ./bandit20-do cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit20
GbKksEFF4yrVs6il55v6gwY5aVje5f0j
```

And we have the password for bandit20, *GbKksEFF4yrVs6il55v6gwY5aVje5f0j*.

---

### Level 21

> Level Goal
> 
>There is a setuid binary in the homedirectory that does the following: it makes a connection to localhost on the port you specify as a commandline argument. It then reads a line of text from the connection and compares it to the password in the previous level (bandit20). If the password is correct, it will transmit the password for the next level (bandit21).
>
>NOTE: Try connecting to your own network daemon to see if it works as you think
>
>Commands you may need to solve this level
>
>ssh, nc, cat, bash, screen, tmux, Unix ‘job control’ (bg, fg, jobs, &, CTRL-Z, …)

Let’s see what we have in our home directory.

```bash
bandit20@bandit:~$ ls
suconnect
```

We have *suconnect*, which is a binary.

> it makes a connection to localhost on the port you specify as a commandline argument

Let’s figure out which port is free.

```bash
bandit20@bandit:~$ nmap -p- localhost
Starting Nmap 7.40 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2021-01-22 12:11 CET
Nmap scan report for localhost (127.0.0.1)
Host is up (0.00027s latency).
Not shown: 65523 closed ports
PORT      STATE SERVICE
22/tcp    open  ssh
113/tcp   open  ident
30000/tcp open  ndmps
30001/tcp open  pago-services1
30002/tcp open  pago-services2
31046/tcp open  unknown
31518/tcp open  unknown
31691/tcp open  unknown
31790/tcp open  unknown
31960/tcp open  unknown
34729/tcp open  unknown
37389/tcp open  unknown
Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 3.70 seconds
```

Let’s go with port 31046, although you could use any of the free ports.
Let’s setup the server to listen to any requests and reply with the password of bandit20.

```bash
bandit20@bandit:~$ echo "GbKksEFF4yrVs6il55v6gwY5aVje5f0j" | nc -l -p 31406 &
[1] 6385
```

The *“&”* at the end of the command is to allow this command to run in the background. We can verify this using *ps aux*.

```bash {9}
bandit20@bandit:~$ ps aux
USER       PID %CPU %MEM    VSZ   RSS TTY      STAT START   TIME COMMAND
bandit20  2027  0.0  0.1  21164  4988 pts/20   Ss   12:11   0:00 -bash
bandit20  5857  0.0  0.1  21164  5020 pts/4    Ss+  12:22   0:00 -bash
bandit20  5999  0.0  0.1  21148  5008 pts/42   Ss+  12:22   0:00 -bash
bandit20  6072  0.0  0.0   4180   688 pts/54   S+   12:22   0:00 nc -l 6969
bandit20  6090  0.0  0.1  21156  5044 pts/18   Ss+  12:22   0:00 -bash
bandit20  6116  0.0  0.0   6300  1640 pts/4    S    12:22   0:00 nc -l -p 31406
bandit20  6385  0.0  0.0   6300  1652 pts/20   S    12:23   0:00 nc -l -p 31406
bandit20  6491  0.0  0.0  19188  2328 pts/20   R+   12:23   0:00 ps aux
bandit20 11417  0.0  0.1  21148  4860 pts/54   Ss   11:34   0:00 -bash
bandit20 28762  0.0  0.1  21148  4996 pts/50   Ss+  11:55   0:00 -bash
```

So now our server knows to reply with the password of bandit20 whenever it receives a connection on port 31406.
Now, let’s use *suconnect*.


```bash
bandit20@bandit:~$ ./suconnect 31406
Read: GbKksEFF4yrVs6il55v6gwY5aVje5f0j
Password matches, sending next password
gE269g2h3mw3pwgrj0Ha9Uoqen1c9DGr
```

And we have the password for bandit21, *gE269g2h3mw3pwgrj0Ha9Uoqen1c9DGr*.

### Level 22

> Level Goal
>
> A program is running automatically at regular intervals from cron, the time-based job scheduler. Look in /etc/cron.d/ for the configuration and see what command is being executed.
>
> Commands you may need to solve this level
> cron, crontab, crontab(5) (use “man 5 crontab” to access this)

Let’s go to */etc/cron.d/* and see what we have.

```bash
bandit21@bandit:~$ cd /etc/cron.d
bandit21@bandit:/etc/cron.d$ ls
cronjob_bandit15_root  cronjob_bandit22  cronjob_bandit24
cronjob_bandit17_root  cronjob_bandit23  cronjob_bandit25_root
bandit21@bandit:/etc/cron.d$ cat cronjob_bandit22
@reboot bandit22 /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit22.sh &> /dev/null
* * * * * bandit22 /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit22.sh &> /dev/null
```

So there’s a job being executed that is located at */usr/bin/cronjob_bandit22.sh*.

```bash
bandit21@bandit:/etc/cron.d$ cat /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit22.sh
#!/bin/bash
chmod 644 /tmp/t7O6lds9S0RqQh9aMcz6ShpAoZKF7fgv
cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit22 > /tmp/t7O6lds9S0RqQh9aMcz6ShpAoZKF7fgv
```

The task changes the permissions of the file */tmp/t7O6lds9S0RqQh9aMcz6ShpAoZKF7fgv*, and writes the password for _bandit22_ into it. Let’s read it.
```bash
bandit21@bandit:/etc/cron.d$ cat /tmp/t7O6lds9S0RqQh9aMcz6ShpAoZKF7fgv
Yk7owGAcWjwMVRwrTesJEwB7WVOiILLI
```

And we have the password for _bandit22_, *Yk7owGAcWjwMVRwrTesJEwB7WVOiILLI*.

---

### Level 23

>Level Goal
>
>A program is running automatically at regular intervals from cron, the time-based job scheduler. Look in /etc/cron.d/ for the configuration and see what command is being executed.
>
>NOTE: Looking at shell scripts written by other people is a very useful skill. The script for this level is intentionally made easy to read. If you are having problems understanding what it does, try executing it to see the debug information it prints.
>
>Commands you may need to solve this level
>cron, crontab, crontab(5) (use “man 5 crontab” to access this)

Simillar to the last level, lets go to */etc/cron.d/*.

```bash
bandit22@bandit:~$ ls /etc/cron.d
cronjob_bandit15_root  cronjob_bandit17_root  cronjob_bandit22  cronjob_bandit23  cronjob_bandit24  cronjob_bandit25_root
```

Let's see what *cronjob_bandit23* does.

```bash
bandit22@bandit:~$ cat /etc/cron.d/cronjob_bandit23
@reboot bandit23 /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit23.sh  &> /dev/null
* * * * * bandit23 /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit23.sh  &> /dev/null
```

*cronjob_bandit23* executes the shell program */usr/bin/cronjob_bandit23.sh*.
Let's see what the program does.

```bash
bandit22@bandit:~$ cat /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit23.sh
#!/bin/bash

myname=$(whoami)
mytarget=$(echo I am user $myname | md5sum | cut -d ' ' -f 1)

echo "Copying passwordfile /etc/bandit_pass/$myname to /tmp/$mytarget"

cat /etc/bandit_pass/$myname > /tmp/$mytarget
```

The program sets the value for 2 variables, *myname* and *mytarget* and _copies the password_ from */etc/bandit_pass* to a file in */tmp/*. 

The value of *myname* is *_whoami_*, which is a command that returns the current user's name. The value of *mytarget* is set as "*echo I am user $myname | md5sum | cut -d ' ' -f 1*", which is an encoded form of "echo I am user $myname", where $myname is replaced by the current user's name. The filename in */tmp/* is the variable *mytarget*. 

Let's try executing the shell program.

```bash
bandit22@bandit:~$ /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit23.sh $whoami=bandit23
Copying passwordfile /etc/bandit_pass/bandit22 to /tmp/8169b67bd894ddbb4412f91573b38db3
```

Since we are in *bandit22*, the *value of myname* is "bandit22", and the *value of mytarget* is the encoded form of the string "echo I am user bandit22", which is "*8169b67bd894ddbb4412f91573b38db3*". If we go to */tmp/8169b67bd894ddbb4412f91573b38db3*, we will find the password for bandit22 (which we already have).

```bash
bandit22@bandit:~$ cat /tmp/8169b67bd894ddbb4412f91573b38db3
Yk7owGAcWjwMVRwrTesJEwB7WVOiILLI
```

Thus, we can assume, that *bandit23's password* must be in a file inside */tmp/*, whose name is an encoded form of the string "*echo I am user bandit23*".

Let's apply the same encoding to the string on our own, since we cant access or modify the contents of the shell program.

```bash
bandit22@bandit:~$ echo I am user bandit23 | md5sum | cut -d ' ' -f 1
8ca319486bfbbc3663ea0fbe81326349
```

Now, let's check inside */tmp/8ca319486bfbbc3663ea0fbe81326349*.

```bash
bandit22@bandit:~$ cat /tmp/8ca319486bfbbc3663ea0fbe81326349
jc1udXuA1tiHqjIsL8yaapX5XIAI6i0n
```

And we have the password for _bandit23_, *jc1udXuA1tiHqjIsL8yaapX5XIAI6i0n*.

### Level 24


>Level Goal
>A program is running automatically at regular intervals from cron, the time-based job scheduler. Look in /etc/cron.d/ for the configuration and see what command is being executed.
>
>NOTE: This level requires you to create your own first shell-script. This is a very big step and you should be proud of yourself when you beat this level!

>
>Commands you may need to solve this level
>cron, crontab, crontab(5) (use “man 5 crontab” to access this)

Simillar to the previous levels, let's find out what job is being executed.

```bash
bandit23@bandit:~$ cat /etc/cron.d/cronjob_bandit24
@reboot bandit24 /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit24.sh &> /dev/null
* * * * * bandit24 /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit24.sh &> /dev/null
bandit23@bandit:~$ cat /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit24.sh
#!/bin/bash

myname=$(whoami)

cd /var/spool/$myname
echo "Executing and deleting all scripts in /var/spool/$myname:"
for i in * .*;
do
    if [ "$i" != "." -a "$i" != ".." ];
    then
        echo "Handling $i"
        owner="$(stat --format "%U" ./$i)"
        if [ "${owner}" = "bandit23" ]; then
            timeout -s 9 60 ./$i
        fi
        rm -f ./$i
    fi
done
```

So we have a script that executes all scripts in */var/spool/bandit24* _every minute_.

>NOTE: This level requires you to create your own first shell-script. This is a very big step and you should be proud of yourself when you beat this level!

So we need to write our own shell script that will fetch the password for *bandit24*, and store it in /var/spool/bandit24. To start, let's create a directory in */tmp/*, so that we can write our own files.

```bash
bandit23@bandit:~$ mkdir /tmp/ijdtihgv
bandit23@bandit:~$ cd /tmp/ijdtihgv
bandit23@bandit:/tmp/ijdtihgv$
```

Let's create 2 files, the script and a file to store the password. The script must be executable by anyone and thus, we'll give it permission of 777, and the password must be writeable by anyone, so we'll give it permission of 666.

```bash
bandit23@bandit:/tmp/ijdtihgv$ touch script.sh
bandit23@bandit:/tmp/ijdtihgv$ chmod 777 script.sh
bandit23@bandit:/tmp/ijdtihgv$ touch password
bandit23@bandit:/tmp/ijdtihgv$ chmod 666 password
```

Now we can write the script that will fetch the password from */etc/bandit_pass/bandit24* and write it in our *password* file.

```bash
bandit23@bandit:/tmp/ijdtihgv$ vim script.sh
```

This opens a text editor in the terminal where we can write our script. 

```bash:title=Script
#! /bin/bash
cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit24 > /tmp/ijdtihgv/password
```

Now let's copy this file to /var/spool/bandit24, and wait for a minute. 

```bash
bandit23@bandit:/tmp/ijdtihgv$ cp script.sh /var/spool/bandit24

(wait for a minute)

bandit23@bandit:/tmp/ijdtihgv$ cat password
UoMYTrfrBFHyQXmg6gzctqAwOmw1IohZ
```

And we have the password for _bandit24_, *UoMYTrfrBFHyQXmg6gzctqAwOmw1IohZ*.

### Level 25

>Level Goal
>A daemon is listening on port 30002 and will give you the password for bandit25 if given the password for bandit24 and a secret numeric 4-digit pincode. There is no way to retrieve the pincode except by going through all of the 10000 combinations, called brute-forcing.





Happy Hacking!
