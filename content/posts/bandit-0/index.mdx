In this post, I’m going to cover Level 0 of [Bandit](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/). This post will also act as an introduction to how Bandit works.

I recommend you follow along as you’re reading this.

So let’s get started!

### Prerequisites

Each level of bandit requires you to use [SSH (Secure Shell)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSH_%28Secure_Shell%29), to login to a user on a server. If this is confusing, just read along and things will become clear.

To play Bandit, all you really need is

1.  A web browser
2.  And a terminal (preferably Linux, although some versions of Windows 10 are also able to run the SSH command)

### Getting Started

Start by visiting [overthewire.org/wargames/](https://overthewire.org/wargames/). OverTheWire encourages self-learning through lots of reading. So definitely read through this intro page to get a good idea of what OverTheWire is about.

Once you’re done, click on the link to Bandit in the menu to the left, which should take you to [overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/). Again, read through this page as well.

And now, it’s time to get started with Level 0.

### Level 0

Once you’re on the Level 0 page, you get the following information,

> **Level Goal**
>
> The goal of this level is for you to log into the game using SSH. The host to which you need to connect is **bandit.labs.overthewire.org**, on port 2220. The username is **bandit0** and the password is **bandit0**. Once logged in, go to the [Level 1](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit1.html) page to find out how to beat Level 1.
>
> **Commands you may need to solve this level**
>
> ssh

What does all this mean? Let me break it down for you.

> The goal of this level is for you to log into the game using SSH.

In simple terms, SSH is a method for secure remote login from one computer to another.

Using a terminal, you can login to another computer, provided, you have the

1.  Username
2.  Host Name
3.  Password
4.  Port Number

And this is exactly what has been to given you in the _Level Goal._

> The host to which you need to connect is **bandit.labs.overthewire.org**, on port **2220**. The username is **bandit0** and the password is **bandit0**.

From this, you can infer the following,

1.  **Host Name:** bandit.labs.overthewire.org
2.  **Port Number:** 2220
3.  **Username:** bandit0
4.  **Password:** bandit0

Now it’s time to whip out your terminal and login to bandit0.

### SSH Syntax

The syntax for using the SSH command is

```
$ ssh username@host\_name -p port\_number
```

To login to bandit0, type the following on your terminal and press enter.

```
$ ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```

You should get the following response,

```
$ ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220  
This is a OverTheWire game server. More information on [http://www.overthewire.org/wargames](http://www.overthewire.org/wargames)

bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org's password:
```

Now, type bandit0 as the password and press enter.

**Note:** You won’t see the cursor moving as you type the password, but that’s just how SSH works.

And you should see a long message welcoming you to the server.

Read through the message to understand how bandit works.

You’ll also notice that your terminal has now changed to

```
bandit0@bandit:~$
```

You have successfully completed Level 0.

Now, onto level 1.

Happy Hacking!
