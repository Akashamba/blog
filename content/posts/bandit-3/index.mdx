In the last post, we gained access to _bandit2._ Now, lets find the password for _bandit3._

### Level 3

> Level Goal
>
> The password for the next level is stored in a file called **spaces in this filename** located in the home directory
>
> Commands you may need to solve this level

> ls, cd, cat, file, du, find

And sure enough, using **_ls_** shows us the file **spaces in this filename.**

```
**bandit2@bandit:**~$ ls  
spaces in this filename
```

Now, if we simply try **_cat filename_**,

```
**bandit2@bandit:**~$ cat spaces in this filename   
cat: spaces: No such file or directory  
cat: in: No such file or directory  
cat: this: No such file or directory  
cat: filename: No such file or directory
```

We see that cat treats each word of the filename as a separate filename.

So we need to make sure that we include the spaces in the filename. There are two ways of doing this.

### 1\. Using Quotes (“”)

```
**bandit2@bandit:**~$ cat “spaces in this filename”  
UmHadQclWmgdLOKQ3YNgjWxGoRMb5luK
```

Doing so passes in the filename as a single parameter to cat, rather than multiple filenames, which is what was happening earlier.

### 2\. Escaping the spaces (\\ )

Another way of dealing with spaces in filenames is to escape the spaces, so that the filename is processed as a single filename.

```
**bandit2@bandit:**~$ cat spaces\\ in\\ this\\ filename   
UmHadQclWmgdLOKQ3YNgjWxGoRMb5luK
```

And clearly, that works too!

Regardless of which method we use, we now have the password for _bandit3_, **UmHadQclWmgdLOKQ3YNgjWxGoRMb5luK.**

So let’s move on to the next level!

Happy Hacking!
