In this post, I’m going to cover the first 7 levels of [Bandit](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/). This post will also act as an introduction to how Bandit works.

I recommend you follow along as you’re reading this.

So let’s get started!

### Prerequisites

Each level of bandit requires you to use [SSH (Secure Shell)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSH_%28Secure_Shell%29), to login to a user on a server. If this is confusing, just read along and things will become clear.

To play Bandit, all you really need is

1.  A web browser
2.  And a terminal (preferably Linux, although some versions of Windows 10 are also able to run the SSH command)

### Getting Started

Start by visiting [overthewire.org/wargames/](https://overthewire.org/wargames/). OverTheWire encourages self-learning through lots of reading. So definitely read through this intro page to get a good idea of what OverTheWire is about.

And now, it’s time to get started with Level 0.

### Level 0

Once you’re on the Level 0 page, you get the following information,

> **Level Goal**
>
> The goal of this level is for you to log into the game using SSH. The host to which you need to connect is **bandit.labs.overthewire.org**, on port 2220. The username is **bandit0** and the password is **bandit0**. Once logged in, go to the [Level 1](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit1.html) page to find out how to beat Level 1.
>
> **Commands you may need to solve this level**
>
> ssh

What does all this mean? Let me break it down for you.

> The goal of this level is for you to log into the game using SSH.

In simple terms, SSH is a method for secure remote login from one computer to another.

Using a terminal, you can login to another computer, provided, you have the

1.  Username
2.  Host Name
3.  Password
4.  Port Number

And this is exactly what has been to given you in the _Level Goal._

> The host to which you need to connect is **bandit.labs.overthewire.org**, on port **2220**. The username is **bandit0** and the password is **bandit0**.

From this, you can infer the following,

1.  **Host Name:** bandit.labs.overthewire.org
2.  **Port Number:** 2220
3.  **Username:** bandit0
4.  **Password:** bandit0

Now it’s time to whip out your terminal and login to bandit0.

### SSH Syntax

The syntax for using the SSH command is

```
$ ssh username@host\_name -p port\_number
```

To login to bandit0, type the following on your terminal and press enter.

```
$ ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```

You should get the following response,

```
$ ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220  
This is a OverTheWire game server. More information on [http://www.overthewire.org/wargames](http://www.overthewire.org/wargames)

bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org's password:
```

Now, type bandit0 as the password and press enter.

**Note:** You won’t see the cursor moving as you type the password, but that’s just how SSH works.

And you should see a long message welcoming you to the server.

Read through the message to understand how bandit works.

You’ll also notice that your terminal has now changed to

```
bandit0@bandit:~$
```

You have successfully completed Level 0.

Now, onto level 1.

The way that Bandit works is, once you login to a _user_ (say, bandit0), you need to perform certain tasks to obtain the password of _next user_ (say, bandit1). Then, using SSH, we can login to the next user.

So now that we’re in _bandit0_, lets figure out the password for _bandit1._

---

### Level 1

The task for Level 1 is to figure out the password of bandit1 from bandit0.

Since we’re already logged into bandit0, we can start looking for the password.

To get the instructions for this level, head on over to the [Level 0 → Level 1](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit1.html) page.

> Level Goal
>
> The password for the next level is stored in a file called **readme** located in the home directory. Use this password to log into bandit1 using SSH. Whenever you find a password for a level, use SSH (on port 2220) to log into that level and continue the game.
>
> Commands you may need to solve this level
>
> ls, cd, cat, file, du, find

So we now know that the password we are looking for is in a file called **readme.** Let’s first find out what’s in our current directory.

We can do this by using the command **_ls_** in our terminal.

```
**bandit0@bandit:**~$ ls  
readme
```

We see that there is a file named **_readme._** To view the contents of the file, we use the command **_cat,_** followed by the name of the file we want to read.

```
**bandit0@bandit:**~$ cat readme  
boJ9jbbUNNfktd78OOpsqOltutMc3MY1
```

According to the instructions, the **_readme_** file contains the password for the next level, _bandit1_. So lets assume the password for _bandit1_ is **_boJ9jbbUNNfktd78OOpsqOltutMc3MY1._**

Lets try logging into _bandit1_ using the password we have just obtained.

To login to bandit1, we have to logout of bandit0 first.

We can do this using the command **_logout._**

```
**bandit0@bandit**:~$ logout  
Connection to bandit.labs.overthewire.org closed.
```

And now, we have to login to bandit1, just like we logged into bandit0, using SSH.

```
$ ssh bandit1@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220  
This is a OverTheWire game server. More information on [http://www.overthewire.org/wargames](http://www.overthewire.org/wargames)

bandit1@bandit.labs.overthewire.org’s password:
```

Paste the password that we just got (again, you won’t see any response, but your password should have been pasted), and press enter.

And you should be logged into _bandit1_!

---

### Level 2

To get the instructions for Level 2, let’s head to the [Level 1 → Level 2](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit2.html) page.

> The password for the next level is stored in a file called - located in the home directory
>
> Commands you may need to solve this level
>
> ls, cd, cat, file, du, find

Just like Level 1, if you try using the **_ls_** command, you’ll see the following,

```
**bandit1@bandit:**~$ ls  
\-
```

This basically means that there’s a file named **-** in our directory.

These files are generally known as **dashed files**, since their names begin with a _dash_ or a _hyphen_.

Now, if we try using the **_cat_** command like last time, the terminal does not return anything.

```
**bandit1@bandit:**~$ cat -
```

Moreover, if we type anything and press _enter,_ the terminal just prints whatever we typed.

```
**bandit1@bandit:**~$ cat -  
test message  
test message
```

This is because files with ‘-’ in the beginning need to be delimited with ‘./’, to differentiate the filename from any options we may provide with the operator.

The dot in the delimiter represents the current directory. So when we say ‘**_./-’_** we’re basically just calling the file named ‘-’ in the current directory.

So to read the contents of **_\-,_** type

```
**bandit1@bandit:**~$ cat ./-  
CV1DtqXWVFXTvM2F0k09SHz0YwRINYA9
```

And we get the password for _bandit2,_ **CV1DtqXWVFXTvM2F0k09SHz0YwRINYA9.**

Now, you can just logout of _bandit1_ and login to _bandit2!_

---

### Level 3

> Level Goal
>
> The password for the next level is stored in a file called **spaces in this filename** located in the home directory
>
> Commands you may need to solve this level
>
> ls, cd, cat, file, du, find

And sure enough, using **_ls_** shows us the file **spaces in this filename.**

```
**bandit2@bandit:**~$ ls  
spaces in this filename
```

Now, if we simply try **_cat filename_**,

```
**bandit2@bandit:**~$ cat spaces in this filename   
cat: spaces: No such file or directory  
cat: in: No such file or directory  
cat: this: No such file or directory  
cat: filename: No such file or directory
```

We see that cat treats each word of the filename as a separate filename.

So we need to make sure that we include the spaces in the filename. There are two ways of doing this.

### 1\. Using Quotes (“”)

```
**bandit2@bandit:**~$ cat “spaces in this filename”  
UmHadQclWmgdLOKQ3YNgjWxGoRMb5luK
```

Doing so passes in the filename as a single parameter to cat, rather than multiple filenames, which is what was happening earlier.

### 2\. Escaping the spaces

Another way of dealing with spaces in filenames is to escape the spaces, so that the filename is processed as a single filename.

```
**bandit2@bandit:**~$ cat spaces\\ in\\ this\\ filename   
UmHadQclWmgdLOKQ3YNgjWxGoRMb5luK
```

And clearly, that works too!

Regardless of which method we use, we now have the password for _bandit3_, **UmHadQclWmgdLOKQ3YNgjWxGoRMb5luK.**

So let’s move on to the next level!

---

### Level 4

> Level Goal
>
> The password for the next level is stored in a hidden file in the **inhere** directory.
>
> Commands you may need to solve this level
>
> ls, cd, cat, file, du, find

Let’s first use **_ls_** and see what we have in our current directory.

```
**bandit3@bandit:**~$ ls  
inhere
```

We see that there’s a directory named **inhere** (depending on your terminal, a directory will have some indication to distinguish it from a file).

> The password for the next level is stored in a hidden file in the **inhere** directory.

So we need to get into the **inhere** directory. Let’s change our **current directory** to **inhere** by using the **_cd_** command.

```
**bandit3@bandit:~$** cd inhere  
**bandit3@bandit:~/inhere$**
```

And we now see that our terminal has changed from **bandit3@bandit:~$** to **bandit3@bandit:~/inhere$.**

This means that we have successfully changed directories.

Now let’s find out what’s there in the **inhere** directory.

```
**bandit3@bandit:~/inhere$** ls  
**bandit3@bandit:~/inhere$**
```

Nothing? Let’s read the Level Goal again.

> The password for the next level is stored in a **hidden** file in the **inhere** directory.

So, the file we’re looking for is hidden.

To view **hidden files**, run the **_ls_** command with the **_\-a_** flag which enables viewing of all files in a directory.

```
**bandit3@bandit:~/inhere$** ls -a  
.  ..  .hidden
```

Now, we see a file named **.hidden** (files whose names begin with a ‘.’ are usually hidden).

Now let’s read the contents of **.hidden**

```
**bandit3@bandit:~/inhere$** cat .hidden  
pIwrPrtPN36QITSp3EQaw936yaFoFgAB
```

And we have the password for _bandit4_!

**pIwrPrtPN36QITSp3EQaw936yaFoFgAB**

---

### Level 5

> The password for the next level is stored in the only human-readable file in the **inhere** directory. Tip: if your terminal is messed up, try the “reset” command.
>
> Commands you may need to solve this level
>
> ls, cd, cat, file, du, find

Let’s first find out what’s in our directory.

```
**bandit4@bandit:~$** ls  
inhere
```

We see the directory, **inhere**. Let’s **_cd_** into **inhere** and find out what we have inside **inhere**.

```
**bandit4@bandit:~$** cd inhere  
**bandit4@bandit:~/inhere$** ls -a  
.   -file00  -file02  -file04  -file06  -file08  
..  -file01  -file03  -file05  -file07  -file09
```

We can see that we have 10 dashed files. From [level 2](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit2.html), we know [how to use cat with dashed files](https://akashambashankar.medium.com/overthewire-bandit-level-2-f126b8f5993d).

So that’s not the challenge of this level.

Let’s try reading **\-file00.**

```
**bandit4@bandit:~/inhere$** cat ./-file00  
�/\`2ғ�%��rL~5�g��� �����
```

That’s definitely not the password for _bandit5._

Let’s take a look at the level goal again.

> The password for the next level is stored in the only **human-readable** file in the **inhere** directory.

Let’s take human readable to mean regular characters, unlike what what we saw in **\-file00**. Clearly **\-file00** was not readable.

The characters that we normally read and write are known as **ASCII Characters.** So out of all the files in the **inhere** directory, we’re looking for the one file which contains **ASCII Characters** (human readable text).

There’s a command called **_file_** that tells us the type of the content of a given file. Let’s try using **_file_** on **\-file00.**

```
**bandit4@bandit:~/inhere$** file ./-file00  
./-file00: data
```

So the contents of **\-file00** are of type **“data”**. So any file with contents of type data is not what we want.

Let’s try doing the same thing for **\-file01**.

```
**bandit4@bandit:~/inhere$** file ./-file01  
./-file01: data
```

So **\-file1** doesn’t contain what we want either.

Now, we could go and do this for each file, since we have only 10 files, and one of them is bound to have ASCII text.

But this isn’t practical when we have a large number of files.

We can do the same thing for every file at one go by using **\***.

```
**bandit4@bandit:~/inhere$** file ./\*  
./-file00: data  
./-file01: data  
./-file02: data  
./-file03: data  
./-file04: data  
./-file05: data  
./-file06: data  
./-file07: ASCII text  
./-file08: data  
./-file09: data
```

And we see that **\-file07** contains ASCII Text.

so let’s read the contents of -file07.

```
**bandit4@bandit:~/inhere$** cat ./-file07  
koReBOKuIDDepwhWk7jZC0RTdopnAYKh
```

And we now have the password for _bandit5!_ **koReBOKuIDDepwhWk7jZC0RTdopnAYKh**

---

### Level 6

> Level Goal
>
> The password for the next level is stored in a file somewhere under the **inhere** directory and has all of the following properties:
>
> human-readable
>
> 1033 bytes in size
>
> not executable
>
> Commands you may need to solve this level
>
> ls, cd, cat, file, du, find

Let’s use **_ls_** and see what we have in our directory.

```
**bandit5@bandit:~$** ls  
inhere
```

So we have a directory named **inhere.** _The Level Goal_ did say that the password is somewhere inside the **inhere** directory. So let’s **_cd_** into **inhere** and find out what’s inside.

```
**bandit5@bandit:~$** cd inhere  
**bandit5@bandit:~/inhere$** ls  
maybehere00  maybehere04  maybehere08  maybehere12  maybehere16  
maybehere01  maybehere05  maybehere09  maybehere13  maybehere17  
maybehere02  maybehere06  maybehere10  maybehere14  maybehere18  
maybehere03  maybehere07  maybehere11  maybehere15  maybehere19
```

So we have 19 sub-directories under **inhere**. So we’re gonna need a way to scan all these directories and find the file containing the password.

Now, what do we know about this file?

> human-readable
>
> 1033 bytes in size
>
> not executable

We’ve already dealt with human readable files in level 5 Human readable implies that the file is not executable (since executable files are in computer readable formats).

and to check the size of the file, we can use the **_find_** command with the **_\-size_** flag.

This will display all files of size 1033 bytes in the current directory.

```
**bandit5@bandit:~/inhere$** find -size 1033c  
./maybehere07/.file2
```

This returns only one file, **./maybehere07/.file2**. So this is the file with our password. But just to be sure, we can run the **_file_** command on **./maybehere07/.file2**, to ensure that it is human readable.

```
**bandit5@bandit:~/inhere$** file ./maybehere07/.file2  
./maybehere07/.file2: ASCII text, with very long lines
```

So we can confirm **./maybehere07/.file2** is indeed human readable, of size 1033 bytes, and not an executable.

```
**bandit5@bandit:~/inhere$** cat ./maybehere07/.file2  
DXjZPULLxYr17uwoI01bNLQbtFemEgo7
```

And we now have the password for _bandit6_.

---

### Level 7

> Level Goal
>
> The password for the next level is stored somewhere on the server and has all of the following properties:
>
> owned by user bandit7  
>  owned by group bandit6  
>  33 bytes in size
>
> Commands you may need to solve this level
>
> ls, cd, cat, file, du, find, grep

So we’re looking for a file owned by user _bandit7_, group _bandit6_, and of size 33 bytes.

The **_find_** command can do all of this for us.

The **_find_** command comes with a _\-user_ flag, _\-group_ flag, and we’ve already seen the _\-size_ flag.

And since the level goal says

> The password for the next level is stored somewhere on the server

we need to search from the root directory, which is represented with a ‘**/**’.

So our final **_find_** command will look like this.

```
**bandit6@bandit:~$** find / -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c

find: ‘/var/cache/ldconfig’: Permission denied
```

But the problem is we get this long output with a lot of errors.

But there is a way to filter out all error messages!

According to this [ask ubuntu page](https://askubuntu.com/questions/350208/what-does-2-dev-null-mean), using **2>/dev/null**, we can filter all error messages.

But what does **2>/dev/null** mean?

### 2>/dev/null

The **2** represents all error messages.

The **\>** is used to redirect output. So **2>** redirects all **error messages**.

**/dev/null** is treated as “black hole” in Linux/Unix systems. It is commonly used to redirect unwanted outputs.

So in short, **2>/dev/null** redirects all error messages to **/dev/null**.

**Note:** Definitely check out this [ask ubuntu page](https://askubuntu.com/questions/350208/what-does-2-dev-null-mean) for more clarity.

Now, if we run the find command along with the redirection, we get

```
**bandit6@bandit:~$** find / -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c 2> /dev/null

/var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password
```

We get the path to one file, which contains the password **HKBPTKQnIay4Fw76bEy8PVxKEDQRKTzs**.
