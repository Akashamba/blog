In the last post, we gained access to _bandit4_. Let’s now use this and find the password for _bandit5._

### Level 5

Let’s first find out what’s in our directory.

```
**bandit4@bandit:~$** ls  
inhere
```

We see the directory, **inhere**. Let’s **_cd_** into **inhere** and find out what we have inside **inhere**.

```
**bandit4@bandit:~$** cd inhere  
**bandit4@bandit:~/inhere$** ls -a  
.   -file00  -file02  -file04  -file06  -file08  
..  -file01  -file03  -file05  -file07  -file09
```

We can see that we have 10 dashed files. From [level 2](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit2.html), we know [how to use cat with dashed files](https://akashambashankar.medium.com/overthewire-bandit-level-2-f126b8f5993d).

So that’s not the challenge of this level.

Let’s try reading **\-file00.**

```
**bandit4@bandit:~/inhere$** cat ./-file00  
�/\`2ғ�%��rL~5�g��� �����
```

That’s definitely not the password for _bandit5._

Let’s take a look at the level goal again.

> The password for the next level is stored in the only **human-readable** file in the **inhere** directory.

Let’s take human readable to mean regular characters, unlike what what we saw in **\-file00**. Clearly **\-file00** was not readable.

The characters that we normally read and write are known as **ASCII Characters.** So out of all the files in the **inhere** directory, we’re looking for the one file which contains **ASCII Characters** (human readable text).

There’s a command called **_file_** that tells us the type of the content of a given file. Let’s try using **_file_** on **\-file00.**

```
**bandit4@bandit:~/inhere$** file ./-file00  
./-file00: data
```

So the contents of **\-file00** are of type **“data”**. So any file with contents of type data is not what we want.

Let’s try doing the same thing for **\-file01**.

```
**bandit4@bandit:~/inhere$** file ./-file01  
./-file01: data
```

So **\-file1** doesn’t contain what we want either.

Now, we could go and do this for each file, since we have only 10 files, and one of them is bound to have ASCII text.

But this isn’t practical when we have a large number of files.

We can do the same thing for every file at one go by using **\***.

```
**bandit4@bandit:~/inhere$** file ./\*  
./-file00: data  
./-file01: data  
./-file02: data  
./-file03: data  
./-file04: data  
./-file05: data  
./-file06: data  
./-file07: ASCII text  
./-file08: data  
./-file09: data
```

And we see that **\-file07** contains ASCII Text.

so let’s read the contents of -file07.

```
**bandit4@bandit:~/inhere$** cat ./-file07  
koReBOKuIDDepwhWk7jZC0RTdopnAYKh
```

And we now have the password for _bandit5!_ **koReBOKuIDDepwhWk7jZC0RTdopnAYKh**

Happy Hacking!
