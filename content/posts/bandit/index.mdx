Hi, my name is Akash Ambashankar, and I’m going to become an ethical hacker. As the first step of my journey, I’m going to playthrough [OverTheWire: Bandit](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/). And as I do that, I’m going to record my learning here, on Medium.com, as a reference for both, my future self, and for anyone who might be stuck on a level.

Therefore, I’m going to explain everything in as much detail as possible, to make sure that I’ve really understood the lessons of each level.

Happy Hacking!
