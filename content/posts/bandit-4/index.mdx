In the last post, we gained access to _bandit3._ Let’s now find the password for _bandit4._

### Level 4

> Level Goal
>
> The password for the next level is stored in a hidden file in the **inhere** directory.
>
> Commands you may need to solve this level
>
> ls, cd, cat, file, du, find

Let’s first use **_ls_** and see what we have in our current directory.

```
**bandit3@bandit:**~$ ls  
inhere
```

We see that there’s a directory named **inhere** (depending on your terminal, a directory will have some indication to distinguish it from a file).

> The password for the next level is stored in a hidden file in the **inhere** directory.

So we need to get into the **inhere** directory. Let’s change our **current directory** to **inhere** by using the **_cd_** command.

```
**bandit3@bandit:~$** cd inhere  
**bandit3@bandit:~/inhere$**
```

And we now see that our terminal has changed from **bandit3@bandit:~$** to **bandit3@bandit:~/inhere$.**

This means that we have successfully changed directories.

Now let’s find out what’s there in the **inhere** directory.

```
**bandit3@bandit:~/inhere$** ls  
**bandit3@bandit:~/inhere$**
```

Nothing? Let’s read the Level Goal again.

> The password for the next level is stored in a **hidden** file in the **inhere** directory.

So, the file we’re looking for is hidden.

To view **hidden files**, run the **_ls_** command with the **_\-a_** flag which enables viewing of all files in a directory.

```
**bandit3@bandit:~/inhere$** ls -a  
.  ..  .hidden
```

Now, we see a file named **.hidden** (files whose names begin with a ‘.’ are usually hidden).

Now let’s read the contents of **.hidden**

```
**bandit3@bandit:~/inhere$** cat .hidden  
pIwrPrtPN36QITSp3EQaw936yaFoFgAB
```

And we have the password for _bandit4_!

Happy Hacking!
